JavaEE -- it is a combinatn of servlets,jsp,jdbc,enterprise jabab bean, jav messaging service
Jakarta is a separate project nt belong to oracle. from jakarta7 JAVAX is replced with JAKARTA(package import)

@Component("nameofcls_with_camelcase") --- used to define a cls as a bean 
@Qualifier("name_of_cls_which_implemnets_beancls)"  -- when there are multiple cls implementing @component bean
spr confuse. so this allow DI 
@Autowired - used for DI when spr scan for component if any cls implementing bean cls then spr automt'ly inject
@PostConstruct - it executes after all the DI happens
@predestroy - it executes after spr cintainer close
@Configuration  - eliminates use of XML. it is the Java configuration class 
@ComponentScan("package path") -- used to define the package for spr configtn
In main we use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext instead of ClassPathXMl for java based configtn cls(no xml)
* HTTPServletRequest - Controller methods are flexible in passing parameters, if we need to read form data in 
Controller cls code then we can use HTTPServletRequest
*Model - Model is jst a container to hold the form data
@InitBinder -- InitBinder method will pre process the request before it going to cntl. ex- in form paswd given as whitespace
then this is we can pre process and delete whitespace//(CustomerCntl)  

@RequestParam
this helps us to read form data and bind automaticallly to thr variable

To Avoid ambiguty btw mappings we use @ReqMap in Controller level to avoid same mapping btw 2 controllers
